## How Does this Application Work?

This is a simple application I have created called "Slotmoji." This application allows users to play a slot machine game but with a twist. The twist is that user can experience the excitement of traditional slot games while expressing their own personality through emojis. Users can incorporate their favorite emojis into the spinning reels, making every spin a unique and entertaining experience. Users can watch as their chosen emojis become part of the reels and potentially align to create winning combinations. This application contains a "Home" page that gives a brief description of the application and a "Game" page where users can play the slot machine. In addition, there is an "Add Emoji" page that allows the user to add emojis to the spinning reels. Directions on how to add emojis to the spinning reels are included on the same page.
