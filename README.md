## How Does this Application Work?

This is a simple application I have created called "Slotmoji." This application allows users to play a slot machine game but with a twist. The twist is that user can experience the excitement of traditional slot games while expressing their own personality through emojis. Users can incorporate their favorite emojis into the spinning reels, making every spin a unique and entertaining experience. Users can watch as their chosen emojis become part of the reels and potentially align to create winning combinations. This application contains a "Home" page that gives a brief description of the application and a "Game" page where users can play the slot machine. In addition, there is an "Add Emoji" page that allows the user to add emojis to the spinning reels. Directions on how to add emojis to the spinning reels are included on the same page.

## Installation

Since this webpage has not been deploy to the public, it cannot be accessed like others, such as _google.com_ or _facebook.com_. It has to be **forked** from **GitHub** and **cloned** to a local computer first. Once it has been cloned locally, navigate to the file and open it in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code. Then, type the command `npm install` in your terminal to install packages and dependencies for the project. Since this application fetches data from `http://localhost:4000/emojis`(local server), run the command line `npm run server` in the terminal to excute json-server tool, allowing it to watch the json file for changes. Then, run the command line `npm start` in the terminal to open the document in a defualt browser. From there, the application can be accessed.

## Resources

All emojis used in the creation of the JSON data for this application are sourced from [emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org/).
