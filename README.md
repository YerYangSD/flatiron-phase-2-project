# Requirements

1. [x] You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using `create-react-app`.
2. [ ] Your app should use `at least 3 components` in a way that keeps your code well organized.
3. [ ] There should be `at least 2 client-side routes` using React RouterLinks to an external site.. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.
4. [ ] Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and `make both a GET and a POST request to the json server`. Use a form to make your post request, `specifically a controlled form/component`. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.

   - You should keep your json-server data simple: avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for this project.
   - Upon return of json from your POST request, a state update by a setState function is required!

# Project Pitch

### Main idea:

This application will allow users to play a simple slot machine game.

### User story:

Users must sign up first before they can play the game. Users will start out with $100 in their wallet and can play $10 per game. Users can insert $100 money into the machine once they ran out of money.

### How will I use the concepts I recently learned to meet the project requirements?

I will use components to separate out my functions. I will need to use useState in my components.

### What area do I think will be most challenging?

I think trying to get the items to move in the machine and making it stop randomly will be a challenge.

# Stretch Goals

1. Use more components and client-side routes.
2. Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch, either by using styled componentsLinks to an external site. or writing CSS files and using id/className to style your elements. You can also incorporate a UI framework (like React BootstrapLinks to an external site., Semantic UILinks to an external site., or Material UILinks to an external site.) if you prefer.
3. Incorporate data from an external API. Check out this list of APIsLinks to an external site. if you need some inspiration!
4. Anything else you'd like! These are only the basic requirements â€” you're free to explore and add on as much stuff as you'd like.
